# Employee-Attrition
Machine Learning model to predict employee attrition rate

#Use the Employee attrition dataset and perform the following:

# 1. Data exploration and data cleaning:

	a. understand the data and get some interesting visuals

	b. check null values

	c. Encode string categorical columns

	d. check the correlation of the numerical columns through heatmap

#2. Model building:

	a. Split the data into test and train with 80% train size and random state 0

	b. Apply decision tree

	c. prune the tree and get the best hyper parameters

	d. Obtain the Confusion matrix, Accuracy, F1 score and ROC-AUC and plot the ROC curve

	e. For this scenario get the best threshold and get the Accuracy, F1 score and AUC values
